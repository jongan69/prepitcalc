This is the Prep it calc react app I built to help me start my fitness adventure in health

The app has gone from being able to run on AWS to being run on Heroku 

The app can be viewed here https://prepitcalc.herokuapp.com

To run this locally:

1. Git clone 
2. Npm install
3. Npm start

It should run smoothly, the homepage has errors because the mongo server is no longer apart of the app so it is using The calculator alone
